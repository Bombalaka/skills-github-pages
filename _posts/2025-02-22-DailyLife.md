## Welcome to my daily blog where I share my journey as a developer, life updates, and thoughts!

### 🌄 Latest Posts

### 🌞 Day 1: A Fresh Start
Today, I set up my GitHub Page. It feels good to finally get my projects organized in one place. I’m planning to learn more about cloud development soon—one step at a time!

### 💻 Day 2: SQL Struggles
I worked on SQL queries today, and wow, it’s tougher than I expected. Took me a while to figure out how to join tables properly, but I made it through! Tomorrow’s goal: practice some more and maybe learn a new command.

### 🐧 Day 3: Linux Baby Steps
I played around with some Linux commands. Just learning how to navigate folders feels like a small victory. Still a long way to go, but it’s fun figuring things out.

Stay tuned for more daily updates!
